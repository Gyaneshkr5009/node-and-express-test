Express Server Setup
Overview
This project demonstrates how to set up an Express server, handle HTTP requests with body-parser, and enable live reloading using nodemon. The project includes a simple route that requires a password to access a hidden HTML file (secret.html).

Prerequisites
Node.js installed on your machine.
Basic knowledge of JavaScript and Node.js.
Installation Steps
Step 1: Install Express
Express is a web framework for Node.js.

bash
Copy code
npm install express
Step 2: Install Body-Parser Middleware
body-parser is a middleware used to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers.

bash
Copy code
npm install body-parser
Step 3: Install Nodemon for Live Reloading
Nodemon monitors your files for changes and automatically restarts the server.

bash
Copy code
npm install nodemon
Step 4: Run the Application
Run the server using node to start the Express app.

bash
Copy code
node index.js
Alternatively, if using nodemon, you can start the app with:

bash
Copy code
npx nodemon index.js
Step 5: Password Access
To access the secret.html file, type the following password:

Copy code
MyNameIsGyanesh
Ensure that your routes and password-handling logic are correctly set up in index.js for this functionality.

Usage
Start the server by running index.js.
Use a browser or a tool like Postman to interact with your server.
Enter the password to access protected content like secret.html.
